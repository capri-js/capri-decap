Capri is an Italian island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the Sorrentine Peninsula, on the south side of the Gulf of Naples in the Campania region of Italy. The main town Capri is located on the island with the same name.

## Geography and Geology

The island has two harbors, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande. The separate comune of Anacapri is located high on the hills to the west. The etymology of the name Capri may ultimately derive from the Greek κάπρος (kapros), meaning "wild boar".

The island is composed of limestone and has a karst topography. Its sides are perpendicular cliffs and the surface is composed of more gentle slopes. The island has a surface area of 10.4 square kilometers.

## Notable Features

The Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra) is a notable sea cave on the coast of the island. Sunlight passing through an underwater cavity and shining through the seawater creates a blue reflection that illuminates the cavern.
