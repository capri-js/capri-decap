Color theory is the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color, and the visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also involves the messages colors communicate, and the methods used to replicate color.

## Primary Colors

In traditional color theory, primary colors are the three pigment colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these three colors:

- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

## Secondary Colors

Secondary colors are colors made by mixing two primary colors in equal amounts:

- Green (blue + yellow)
- Orange (red + yellow)
- Purple (red + blue)

## Color Properties

Colors have three main properties that can be adjusted:

### Hue

Hue is the pure color itself, without any mixing with black, white, or gray. It is the color's position on the color wheel and is typically identified by the color's name, such as red, yellow, or blue.

### Value (Brightness)

Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. Value can be changed by adding white or black:

- Tint: Color + White
- Shade: Color + Black
- Tone: Color + Gray

### Saturation (Intensity)

Saturation refers to the purity or intensity of a color. A highly saturated color is vivid, while a less saturated color appears more muted and gray.

## Color Harmonies

Color harmonies are the foundation of color schemes used in design:

1. **Complementary Colors**

   - Colors opposite each other on the color wheel
   - Create maximum contrast and stability

2. **Analogous Colors**

   - Colors next to each other on the color wheel
   - Create harmonious and pleasing designs

3. **Triadic Colors**
   - Three colors equally spaced around the color wheel
   - Offer vibrant contrast while retaining harmony

## Color Psychology

Different colors are known to have different psychological effects:

- Red: Energy, passion, danger
- Blue: Trust, peace, stability
- Yellow: Optimism, clarity, warmth
- Green: Growth, harmony, safety
- Purple: Royalty, luxury, ambition
- Orange: Confidence, friendliness, courage

## Color Models

### RGB (Digital)

Used in digital displays, combining red, green, and blue light:

- Values from 0 to 255 for each channel
- White is (255, 255, 255)
- Black is (0, 0, 0)

### CMYK (Print)

Used in printing, combining cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black):

- Values expressed as percentages
- Subtractive color model
- Standard for print production
